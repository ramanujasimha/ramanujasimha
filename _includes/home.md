Hello! I am Ramanuja, a post-doctoral researcher at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) / [UHN](http://www.uhn.ca/), Canada. My research interests lie in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [graphical modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_model), [data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining), and [computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology). Some of the topics I have worked on include [multi-label classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification) and [social network analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis). 

I graduated with a PhD in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) from the [University of Delaware](http://www.udel.edu/), USA in August 2016. For my PhD, I developed machine learning tools for [protein multi-location prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_subcellular_localization_prediction) as well as for the more general problem of multi-label classification. 

My graduate experience includes internships at [GE Global Resarch](http://www.geglobalresearch.com/) in Niskayuna NY, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) in Mountain View CA, and [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/about-ncar) in Boulder CO, and summer research at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/) in Pittsburgh PA. 

I got my Masters in [Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science) from the [University of South Florida](http://www.usf.edu/). Prior to my graduate studies, I worked as a software engineer at [Tesco](http://www.tesco.com/) in the UK and in India. Even before that, I received my BE in Information Science from the [National Institute of Engineering](http://www.nie.ac.in/).
